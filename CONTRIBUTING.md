# Contributing to VortexaSDK


## Suggesting new features / Reporting An Issue

First, check to see if there's an existing issue/pull request for the
bug/feature. All issues are at https://github.com/vortechsa/python-sdk/issues and pull reqs are at
https://github.com/vortechsa/python-sdk/pulls.

If there isn't an existing issue there, please file an issue. The
ideal report includes:

-  A description of the problem/suggestion.
-  How to recreate the bug (including the version on your python interpreter).
-  If possible, create a pull request with a (failing) test case
   demonstrating what's wrong. This makes the process for fixing bugs
   quicker & gets issues resolved sooner.

## Setting up your environment

First, clone the repo, then `cd` into the repo.

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:vortechsa/python-sdk.git
$ cd python-sdk
```

create a new virtual environment
```bash
$ python3.7 -m venv venv
```

activate your environment
```bash
$ . venv/bin/activate
```

install the required dependencies
```
$ pip install -e '.[tests]'
```

To run the live tests, you'll need to have the `VORTEXA_API_KEY` environment variable set.

run tests
```
$ python setup.py test
```

serve documentation
```bash
$ ./docs/scripts/serve_docs.sh
```
…and view the docs at http://localhost:8000 in your web browser.

Install the git [pre-commit-hooks](https://pre-commit.com/#3-install-the-git-hook-scripts)
```bash
$ pre-commit install
```


:tada: Now you're ready to create a new branch, add a feature or fix a bug, then send us a pull request! :tada:

## Contributing Code

A good pull request:
-  Is clear.
-  Follows the existing style of the code base (PEP-8).
-  Has comments included as needed.
-  A test case that demonstrates the previous flaw that now passes with
   the included patch, or demonstrates the newly added feature.
-  If it adds/changes a public API, it must also include documentation
   for those changes.

Tips:
- If you're adding a new endpoint, adapt and use `./docs/generate_stubs.sh` to generate sample json data used for tests.
