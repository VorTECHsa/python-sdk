Let's find all crude cargo movements from Saudi Arabia to India that loaded in the last month.

The below script returns a `pd.DataFrame`, similar to the table given in the movements tab of `https://analytics.vortexa.com`,
 filtering on `Products: Crude` with `Origin: Saudi Arabia`, `Destination: India` and `Date Range: Departures in the last Month`.
