    Generic container class holding a `key <> value` pair, a `count`, and optionally a `label` and a `breakdown` of records contributing to the given value.

    For example, this class could hold the average speed of vessels (`value`) on 2019-01-01 (`key`), the number of vessels contributing to the
    this average (count) and additional information about the aggregation (`breakdown`).

    If the `BreakdownItem` is enriched by reference data (e.g. in `fleet-utilisation/breakdown/origin`), `key` is the ID of the reference entity, `label` holds its name
    and `value` and `count` correspond to numeric values of the returned record.
